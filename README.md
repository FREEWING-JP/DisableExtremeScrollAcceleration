DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration
================================

This app disables the new scroll acceleration introduced in Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion). If you're like me, you might make rapid, small scrolling gestures when scanning a document. Mountain Lion changed the scrolling behavior such that after a few of these rapid gestures, 'extreme acceleration' occurs, causing the document to scroll far more than I usually intend. This app disables this behavior.

__===== DOWNLOAD =====__

[The compiled app can be downloaded here.](https://github.com/downloads/davekeck/DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration/DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration.zip)

__===== INSTALLATION =====__

To install the app, put it a safe place (e.g. /Applications), and set it to be launched when you log in (using the 'Users & Groups' preference pane in System Preferences.) Note that this app has no user interface -- the app does its work in the background and immediately quits.
